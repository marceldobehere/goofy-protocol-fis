    ### External Service Access
    These Endpoints get used by services.

    Basically for a user there are two things:
    * Services connected to a identity (Used for login)
        * Basically just a list of services and identities
        * Useful so you can "autofill" the "login" credentials for a service
    * Service Data Access, so giving a service permission to create/read/write tables and buckets. Each Service Data Access will have the service and the handle and then a local scope name,

    -> Login/Config/Access

    #### Get Service name


    #### (REDIRECT) Add Service Access to Handle
    This should be a URL that services can link users to which should redirect users to a (ideally) Frontend Page of the FIS where a logged in user can add the service (defined in the query parameter) to a handle.

    This is there to make the userflow easier.

    This can be used to setup Service Entry / Basic Data Access with Tables / Buckets but also without, just to have the service be "connected" with the user/identity so that it can be used to login.


    #### (REDIRECT) Get Service Login Credentials / Keypair
    This should be a URL that services can link users to which should redirect users to a (ideally) Frontend Page of the FIS where a logged in user can get all handles associated with the service (defined in the query parameter) and can get the keypair which can be used to log in.

    It could potentially add a link to the service which would get the credentials in the url (ideally encoded inside the fragment `#` portion for security reasons) so that the user can get signed in by just selecting the handle and getting redirected to the specific service url.

    This is there to make the userflow easier.
